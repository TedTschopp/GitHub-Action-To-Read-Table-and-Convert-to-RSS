      <title>Oldcastle Accelerates Document Processing with Amazon Bedrock [ ! ]</title>
      <link>https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/oldcastle-accelerates-document-processing-with-amazon-bedrock/</link>
      <description>This is a strong enterprise use case: moving from very low OCR accuracy (~30-40%) on unstructured documents to much higher accuracy and massive scale via combining OCR + LLM processing. Our analysts saw this as a “win case” that many organizations can replicate with unstructured data, showing immediate value.</description>

      <title>On Working with Wizards [ ! ]</title>
      <link>https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/on-working-with-wizards</link>
      <description>This reflection post pushes beyond “what AI does” to consider how humans should position themselves with respect to powerful AI agents (“wizards”) — when to call on them, when to use them as co-intelligence, and when to just be audience or inspector. Our analysts found the arguments resonant and important for leadership: decision rights, evaluating outputs, dealing with opacity, managing human-AI collaboration are going to be central.</description>

      <description>This release presents strong architectural innovations (hybrid attention, sparse MoE, multi-token prediction) and shows large efficiency gains—much lower compute in training vs previous models, faster inference especially at long context lengths. However, our analysts saw it as incremental—useful if you're deep into model architectures or using Qwen models, but not broadly transformative.</description>

      <link>https://research.google/blog/vaultgemma-the-worlds-most-capable-differentially-private-llm/</link>
      <description>VaultGemma’s value comes from addressing one of AI’s most critical challenges—privacy—by being a large language model with strong differential privacy guarantees and a predictable tradeoff between noise, model size, and loss. While still in the research phase, tour analysts agreed this represents a meaningful step toward addressing AI privacy at scale.</description>

      <title>Writing effective tools for agents — with agents [ * ]</title>
      <link>https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/writing-tools-for-agents</link>
      <description>This article provides best practices around designing tools in agentic systems—how agents pick tools, how to build and test them, and how agents themselves can help refine these tools. It’s practical for teams building real agent architectures. Our analysts agreed that it’s practical for teams building real agent architectures though not necessarily urgent for every executive at this moment.</description>

      <link>https://menlovc.com/perspective/ais-ui-problem-is-actually-a-new-era-of-software/</link>
      <description>This article emphasizes that the true value in AI products is increasingly shifting from the visible user interface to the underlying architecture—specifically how prompts are grounded, tools orchestrated, and logic composed, often referred to as the "middleware" or "work layer." Our analysts highlighted that this foundational layer is becoming critical to the effectiveness of AI systems, noting that many platforms lack robustness in the logic and orchestration that drive real functionality—an insight AI leaders must prioritize.</description>

      <title>How successful Sales Teams Are Embracing Agentic AI [ ~ ]</title>
      <link>https://hbr.org/2025/09/how-successful-sales-teams-are-embracing-agentic-ai</link>
      <description>This HBR article outlines the potential of agentic AI in transforming sales but offers few specifics or case studies to show how that transformation is actually taking place. While it may be useful to AI leaders who haven’t yet begun thinking about AI in the sales funnel—a group our analysts believe is now in the minority—it lacks the depth or new insights needed to guide those already exploring this workflow.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10147</link>
      <description>This is a theoretical framework paper from Google proposing a "sandbox economy" where AI agents interact economically, highlighting concepts like permeability and emergent agent behavior. Our analysts criticized it as a lightweight rehash of older economic ideas, saying it lacked grounding in real-world AI applications and did not offer actionable insights — making it a purely speculative read.</description>

      <title>OpenAI will start asking for your ID in some cases as part of ChatGPT protections for teens [ * ]</title>
      <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-will-start-asking-for-your-id-in-some-cases-as-part-of-chatgpt</link>
      <description>OpenAI is introducing age‑prediction systems, automatic restrictions for under‑18 users (such as disabling flirtatious content, self‑harm instructions), parental controls, and in some cases ID verification. This is a big move in safety, ethics, and regulation for chatbots. Our analysts agreed that leaders need to know this, though it doesn’t directly impact enterprise workflows much — its importance lies in policy, user expectations, safety, and potentially compliance.</description>

      <description>This is a powerful case study showing how generative AI automates a very manual, tedious comparison task — Verisk now uses a chat‑style assistant to highlight changes in ISO rating documents, reducing what used to take days down to hours. Our analysts emphasized this as a useful, immediately applicable example: it shows clear ROI, complexity being handled, and value to users who don’t necessarily have deep AI expertise — making it essential reading.</description>

      <description>This report reveals detailed, real‑world data from over 150 countries and all U.S. states on how Claude.ai and enterprise APIs are being used, showing not only what tasks are growing (education, science, coding) but also revealing large geographic/socioeconomic disparities in adoption. Our analysts highlighted that this kind of fine‑grained, open data is hugely informative, especially for seeing where AI is taking off vs where it’s lagging — making this critical for leaders thinking about economic impact and equitable access.</description>

      <title>AI Generated “Workslop” Is Destroying Productivity [ ! ]</title>
      <link>https://hbr.org/2025/09/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity</link>
      <description>The article introduces a term “Workslop” when employees use AI to produce content that masquerades as good work, but lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a given task. Such workslop causes wasted time, frustration, and low return on investment despite widespread adoption of AI tools. Our analysts emphasized this as an emerging problem that leaders can and must control: setting up vetting, quality processes, human review, etc. They saw it as essential because unchecked workslop undermines productivity, credibility, and effectiveness of AI deployments.</description>
