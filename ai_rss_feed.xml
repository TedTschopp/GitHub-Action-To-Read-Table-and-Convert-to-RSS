      <title>Stop Running So Many AI Pilots [ * ]</title>
      <link>https://hbr.org/2025/11/stop-running-so-many-ai-pilots</link>
      <description>This piece argues that AI leaders should move away from excessive pilot programs and instead focus on fewer, deeper, and more strategically aligned initiatives, citing Reckitt’s concentrated value-loop approach. The team emphasized that only 4% of companies take this “deep and narrow” route, yet those that do see twice the ROI, making it a compelling model for organizations looking to operationalize AI rather than just experiment. It also serves as a practical guide for prioritizing long-term, integrated AI deployments over scattered proofs of concept.</description>
