        "text": "This research paper introduces a three-part framework: generator, reflector, and curator, for improving LLMs by refining context (prompts, memories, evidence) rather than retraining models. While still theoretical, our analysts viewed it as an important early architecture for agentic systems, particularly for R&D teams exploring agent role definition, memory persistence, and team-level self-improvement in AI environments.",
