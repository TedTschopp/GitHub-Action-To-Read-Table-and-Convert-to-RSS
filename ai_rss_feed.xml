      <title>The Case for Using Small Language Models [ * ]</title>
      <link>https://hbr.org/2025/09/the-case-for-using-small-language-models</link>
      <description>This HBR piece underscores why small language models that are orders of magnitude smaller yet fine-tuned and edge-capable are poised to redefine AI deployments, offering speed, cost-efficiency, and enhanced data security. Our analysts noted that although the article sometimes oversimplifies model behavior, the emerging focus on operational effectiveness and AI in constrained environments makes it crucial for AI leaders to grasp this shift toward leaner, more sustainable AI architectures.</description>

      <title>AI Will Supercharge Modelbusters [ * ]</title>
      <link>https://a16z.com/ai-will-supercharge-modelbusters/</link>
      <description>In this a16z Growth Newsletter, the authors argue that AI is powering “modelbusters” — companies that deliver 10× better product experiences at 1/10th the cost — and propose emerging business models to capture the resulting exponential opportunity. Our analysts cautioned that while it captures the massive potential of AI in reshaping total addressable markets, it leans heavily on hype and lacks discussion of governance, risk, and the darker facets of AI deployment.</description>

      <title>What Happened When Researchers Co‑Founded a Startup with AI [ ! ]</title>
      <link>https://hbr.org/2025/09/what-happened-when-researchers-co-founded-a-startup-with-ai</link>
      <description>This Harvard Business Review piece explores a provocative experiment where MBA students at NYU Stern, in collaboration with Microsoft, embedded AI as the “first hire” — using conversational prompts instead of traditional business planning to shape everything from market analysis to organizational structure. Our analysts found it “absolutely essential” reading because it reframes AI as a strategic colleague from day one, with insights on supervisory roles, human oversight, and the role of AI in redefining startup formation.</description>

      <title>SafetyKit’s blueprint for scaling risk agents with OpenAI’s most capable models [ ~ ]</title>
      <link>https://openai.com/index/safetykit/</link>
      <description>It’s a useful case study, especially in security and risk agent design, but the discussion noted the lack of depth: not enough detail around how models were chosen, what trade-offs, enough technical or organizational specificity. Our analysts felt it didn’t rise to the level of “must-know” for AI leaders.</description>

      <link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/openai-and-oracle-reportedly-ink-historic-cloud-computing-deal</link>
      <description>The size and terms of this deal matter: OpenAI committing to purchase ~$300B in compute over five years from Oracle signals a major shift in how compute is sourced, partnerships structured, and how AI infrastructure power is balanced. Our analysts saw this alignment as consequential for enterprise strategy, vendor competition, and the futures of Microsoft, OpenAI, Oracle.</description>

      <description>This Stripe report reveals that AI startups are hitting revenue milestones far faster than past generations (SaaS etc.), and that many are global from day one — trends that fundamentally reshape expectations for AI monetization and scale. Our analysts underscored how this offers critical benchmarking data: knowing how vendor strength, international expansion, business models, and growth rates are shifting is vital for AI leaders to plan strategy and vendor relationships.</description>

      <link>https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/oldcastle-accelerates-document-processing-with-amazon-bedrock/</link>
      <description>This is a strong enterprise use case: moving from very low OCR accuracy (~30-40%) on unstructured documents to much higher accuracy and massive scale via combining OCR + LLM processing. Our analysts saw this as a “win case” that many organizations can replicate with unstructured data, showing immediate value.</description>

      <title>On Working with Wizards [ ! ]</title>
      <link>https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/on-working-with-wizards</link>
      <description>This reflection post pushes beyond “what AI does” to consider how humans should position themselves with respect to powerful AI agents (“wizards”) — when to call on them, when to use them as co-intelligence, and when to just be audience or inspector. Our analysts found the arguments resonant and important for leadership: decision rights, evaluating outputs, dealing with opacity, managing human-AI collaboration are going to be central.</description>

      <description>This release presents strong architectural innovations (hybrid attention, sparse MoE, multi-token prediction) and shows large efficiency gains—much lower compute in training vs previous models, faster inference especially at long context lengths. However, our analysts saw it as incremental—useful if you're deep into model architectures or using Qwen models, but not broadly transformative.</description>

      <description>This HBR article outlines the potential of agentic AI in transforming sales but offers few specifics or case studies to show how that transformation is actually taking place. While it may be useful to AI leaders who haven’t yet begun thinking about AI in the sales funnel—a group our analysts believe is now in the minority—it lacks the depth or new insights needed to guide those already exploring this workflow.</description>

      <title>Virtual Agent Economies [ ~ ]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10147</link>
      <description>This is a theoretical framework paper from Google proposing a "sandbox economy" where AI agents interact economically, highlighting concepts like permeability and emergent agent behavior. Our analysts criticized it as a lightweight rehash of older economic ideas, saying it lacked grounding in real-world AI applications and did not offer actionable insights — making it a purely speculative read.</description>

      <title>OpenAI will start asking for your ID in some cases as part of ChatGPT protections for teens [ * ]</title>
      <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-will-start-asking-for-your-id-in-some-cases-as-part-of-chatgpt</link>
      <description>OpenAI is introducing age‑prediction systems, automatic restrictions for under‑18 users (such as disabling flirtatious content, self‑harm instructions), parental controls, and in some cases ID verification. This is a big move in safety, ethics, and regulation for chatbots. Our analysts agreed that leaders need to know this, though it doesn’t directly impact enterprise workflows much — its importance lies in policy, user expectations, safety, and potentially compliance.</description>

      <title>Chinese Officials Urge Firms to Shun Nvidia AI Chips [ ~ ]</title>
      <link>https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/china-nvidia-ai-chips-fbdbc30a?st=qxPeBp&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter</link>
      <description>The article reports that Chinese authorities are pressuring domestic firms to avoid using Nvidia’s AI chips, signaling continued geopolitical tension and efforts toward AI sovereignty and supply chain decoupling. Our analysts judged it as contextually relevant as it reflects a larger US-China conflict over AI infrastructure, this article does not explore those dynamics in depth, thus not immediately actionable for most AI leaders.</description>
