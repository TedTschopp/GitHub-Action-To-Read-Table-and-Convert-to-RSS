      <title>Forget Fine‑Tuning: SAP’s RPT‑1 Brings Ready‑to‑Use AI for Business Tasks [ ~ ]</title>
      <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/forget-fine-tuning-saps-rpt-1-brings-ready-to-use-ai-for-business-tasks</link>
      <description>This article covers SAP’s release of RPT‑1, a relational (“tabular”) foundation model aimed at business‑data tasks out of the box (e.g., spreadsheets, transactional data) rather than typical LLM fine‑tuning. While potentially interesting, our analysts judged it as early in market impact and less directly actionable for many AI leaders now.</description>
