      <title>Building the Next Generation of Physical Agents with Gemini Robotics‑ER 1.5 [ * ]</title>
      <link>https://developers.googleblog.com/en/building-the-next-generation-of-physical-agents-with-gemini-robotics-er-15/</link>
      <description>Gemini Robotics‑ER 1.5 is the first open embodied reasoning model that lets robots perceive, plan, use tools, and act in complex physical environments. Our analysts weighed its significance (combining language models + physical planning) and discussed whether it should be essential and ultimately rated “important” because the domain of robotics still touches fewer AI leaders today but agreed that in the field of Robotics, this is essential news.</description>

      <title>JetBrains Pioneers Multi‑Agent IDE Experience with Claude Agent [ ~ ]</title>
      <link>https://www.claude.com/customers/jetbrains-2</link>
      <description>JetBrains embedding Claude Agent in its IDE is a neat demonstration of integrating agents into developer tools — but the article lacks metrics or deep insight, so our analysts saw it as a light product story.</description>

      <title>Agent Workflows by Eleven Labs [ ~ ]</title>
      <link>https://elevenlabs.io/docs/agents-platform/customization/agent-workflows</link>
      <description>Eleven Labs now lets users visually build branching, subagent‑based conversational flows, enabling per‑step model switching and custom behavior. But our analysts considered it more product update than paradigm shift, given how many workflow tools are emerging.</description>

      <title>IBM claims 45% productivity gains with Project Bob [ * ]</title>
      <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/ibm-claims-45-productivity-gains-with-project-bob-its-multi-model-ide-that</link>
      <description>IBM’s Project Bob is an enterprise-focused AI‑first IDE that orchestrates multiple models and integrates governance (AgentOps) to bridge prototype-to-production. Our analysts viewed it as a significant signal: enterprise AI is moving toward agentic workflows and governance, not just coding assistants.</description>

      <title>Petri: An open‑source auditing tool to accelerate AI safety research [ ! ]</title>
      <link>https://www.anthropic.com/research/petri-open-source-auditing</link>
      <description>Petri offers a tool for inspecting and auditing foundational models — not just a paper, but a concrete software artifact aimed squarely at alignment and model drift. Our analysts underscored that explainability, model oversight, and open alternatives are essential building blocks as generative AI scales.</description>

      <title>LFM2‑8B‑A1B: An Efficient On-device Mixture‑of‑Experts [ ~ ]</title>
      <link>https://www.liquid.ai/blog/lfm2-8b-a1b-an-efficient-on-device-mixture-of-experts</link>
      <description>This model enables on-device inference via a mixture‑of‑experts architecture (8B total, ~1.5B active), delivering performance akin to a 3–4B model on mobile and laptop. Our analysts appreciated the architectural ingenuity, but judged it a technical product release rather than broadly relevant to general AI strategy at this stage.</description>

      <description>Jamba Reasoning 3B offers a 250K context on a relatively small 3B‑parameter model, pushing the capabilities of “small” LLMs. Our analysts broadly agreed it is interesting in a crowded space of small models, but they did not see it as differentiated enough right now to demand broader attention.</description>

      <title>Introducing the Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model [ ~ ]</title>
      <link>https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-computer-use-model</link>
      <description>The Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model can navigate web interfaces (click, type, scroll) — a move toward more agent-like capabilities in browser environments. But our analysts characterized it as a “catch-up” feature from Google, limited currently to web-level controls and not yet mature enough to merit higher urgency.</description>

      <description>Ling‑1T is a trillion‑parameter model optimized for reasoning and scaling, incorporating innovations like “EVO‑CoT” (evolutionary chain-of-thought) and a 128K context window. Our analysts flagged it as noteworthy because of its algorithmic advances and open architecture, and as a sign that China is pushing aggressively on the open AI frontier.</description>

      <description>This piece demonstrates a deployed, revenue‑impacting use of multi‑agent AI, showing how Vxceed built a “storyteller” framework on Amazon Bedrock to generate personalized pitches at scale — a concrete example of AI-driven sales automation. Our analysts emphasized that it’s not just a prototypical use case but in production, includes multiple cooperating agents, and offers a blueprint for organizations to emulate.</description>
