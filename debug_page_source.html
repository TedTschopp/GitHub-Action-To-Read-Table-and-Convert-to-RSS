He contrasts Apple's approach, in which they're utilizing small models for discrete tasks and abstracting GenAI away versus a company like OpenAI using a giant model and putting GenAI forward. It also emphasizes the need for companies to build trust, something Apple prides itself in putting first and was the topic of our David De Lallo's popular Sunday AI comic a few weeks ago.
