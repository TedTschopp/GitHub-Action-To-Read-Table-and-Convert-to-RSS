      <title>Energy‑Based Transformers are Scalable Learners and Thinkers [ ~ ]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02092</link>
      <description>This paper introduces Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs)—a novel model architecture that frames prediction as energy minimization over input–output pairs, enabling models to "think" at inference time without extra supervision or modality-specific tuning. EBTs generalize across domains (text and vision) and outperform traditional transformer models in both efficiency and generalization. Our analysts noted it’s compelling for theory, but distant from practical deployment.</description>

      <description>Grafana has partnered with Anthropic to add Claude-powered natural language querying to its observability platform, allowing non-technical users to interact with structured system data more intuitively. However, our analysts noted that the term "observability" here refers to traditional infrastructure and IT system monitoring—not model-level observability for AI systems—making the use case valuable but ultimately narrow and lacking detail on measurable outcomes.</description>
