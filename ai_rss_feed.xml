      <title>Your Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task [ ! ]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08872</link>
      <description>A study from MIT and collaborators using EEG and fMRI shows that users who relied on LLMs like ChatGPT for essay writing exhibited significantly lower brain activity in memory and reasoning regions, both during and after the task. Analysts viewed this as a stark warning about the cognitive consequences of LLM dependency, linking it to “bicycles of the mind” vs. “cars of the mind” metaphors, tools that amplify vs. tools that replace, and highlighting how over-reliance on generative AI could erode core cognitive skills if not actively mitigated.</description>
