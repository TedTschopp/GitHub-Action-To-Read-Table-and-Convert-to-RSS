      <title>From Branches to Bots: Will AI Agents Transform Retail Banking? [ ~ ]</title>
      <link>https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/branches-to-bots-will-ai-transform-retail-banking</link>
      <description>This article outlines a theoretical vision of the “AI-first bank,” forecasting potential financial gains from deploying AI agents across customer and operational workflows. Our analysts found the concept intriguing but noted it lacked actionable detail or implementation strategy, making it more relevant to banking futurists than to practitioners.</description>

      <title>Introducing Parallel Search: the highest accuracy web search API engineered for AI [ * ]</title>
      <link>https://parallel.ai/blog/introducing-parallel-search</link>
      <description>Parallel introduces a machine-readable web search API optimized for LLMs and AI agents, designed to enhance retrieval accuracy and lower inference costs. Our analysts saw this as a potentially transformative step in enabling more efficient AI agent behavior, especially in orchestrated environments where agents need to fetch, rank, and act on real-time information. Its relevance grows as businesses grapple with token costs and the shift from human-readable to machine-readable web architecture.</description>

      <title>Stop Running So Many AI Pilots [ * ]</title>
      <link>https://hbr.org/2025/11/stop-running-so-many-ai-pilots</link>
      <description>This piece argues that AI leaders should move away from excessive pilot programs and instead focus on fewer, deeper, and more strategically aligned initiatives, citing Reckitt’s concentrated value-loop approach. The team emphasized that only 4% of companies take this “deep and narrow” route, yet those that do see twice the ROI, making it a compelling model for organizations looking to operationalize AI rather than just experiment. It also serves as a practical guide for prioritizing long-term, integrated AI deployments over scattered proofs of concept.</description>

      <title>Introducing Kimi K2 Thinking [ ! ]</title>
      <link>https://moonshotai.github.io/Kimi-K2/thinking.html</link>
      <description>This article introduces Moonshot AI’s Kimi K2, a trillion-parameter open-source model designed to support agentic behavior and capable of executing 200–300 sequential tool calls. Analysts noted this model’s strong benchmark performance and described it as a potential inflection point, where Chinese open-source models may leapfrog U.S. proprietary systems in agent-based AI architecture. Its native design for multi-agent orchestration highlights a broader strategic shift toward complex, tool-using models in global AI development.</description>
