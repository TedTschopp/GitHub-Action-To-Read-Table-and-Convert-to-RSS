      "Rationale": {
        "text": "Google’s Gemini 2.5 introduces advanced conversational segmentation that allows users to refer to image elements abstractly (e.g., “the person not wearing a hard hat”) for real-time annotation and editing. Analysts acknowledged the technical progress and future potential in areas like robotics and military vision systems, but ultimately viewed it as another “everyday miracle” with no immediate application for most AI leaders, placing it in the optional category until more use cases and integrations emerge.",
