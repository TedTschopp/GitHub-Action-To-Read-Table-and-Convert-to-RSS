      <description>As businesses integrate generative AI into real workflows, they are facing rising costs due to “token explosion” in large language models (LLMs), where complex tasks require exponentially more tokens. Our analysts rated this article as essential because it challenges misconceptions about AI cost deflation and underscores the critical need for leaders to understand total cost of ownership—not just per-token pricing—as they scale AI solutions.</description>
