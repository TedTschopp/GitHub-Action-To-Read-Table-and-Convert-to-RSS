      <title>AI Generated “Workslop” Is Destroying Productivity [ ! ]</title>
      <link>https://hbr.org/2025/09/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity</link>
      <description>The article introduces a term “Workslop” when employees use AI to produce content that masquerades as good work, but lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a given task. Such workslop causes wasted time, frustration, and low return on investment despite widespread adoption of AI tools. Our analysts emphasized this as an emerging problem that leaders can and must control: setting up vetting, quality processes, human review, etc. They saw it as essential because unchecked workslop undermines productivity, credibility, and effectiveness of AI deployments.</description>
