      <title>Writing effective tools for agents — with agents [ * ]</title>
      <link>https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/writing-tools-for-agents</link>
      <description>This article provides best practices around designing tools in agentic systems—how agents pick tools, how to build and test them, and how agents themselves can help refine these tools. It’s practical for teams building real agent architectures. Our analysts agreed that it’s practical for teams building real agent architectures though not necessarily urgent for every executive at this moment.</description>

      <title>AI’s UI Problem Is Actually A New Era of Software [ ! ]</title>
      <link>https://menlovc.com/perspective/ais-ui-problem-is-actually-a-new-era-of-software/</link>
      <description>This article emphasizes that the true value in AI products is increasingly shifting from the visible user interface to the underlying architecture—specifically how prompts are grounded, tools orchestrated, and logic composed, often referred to as the "middleware" or "work layer." Our analysts highlighted that this foundational layer is becoming critical to the effectiveness of AI systems, noting that many platforms lack robustness in the logic and orchestration that drive real functionality—an insight AI leaders must prioritize.</description>

      <title>How successful Sales Teams Are Embracing Agentic AI [ ~ ]</title>
      <link>https://hbr.org/2025/09/how-successful-sales-teams-are-embracing-agentic-ai</link>
      <description>This HBR article outlines the potential of agentic AI in transforming sales but offers few specifics or case studies to show how that transformation is actually taking place. While it may be useful to AI leaders who haven’t yet begun thinking about AI in the sales funnel—a group our analysts believe is now in the minority—it lacks the depth or new insights needed to guide those already exploring this workflow.</description>

      <title>Virtual Agent Economies [ ~ ]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10147</link>
      <description>This is a theoretical framework paper from Google proposing a "sandbox economy" where AI agents interact economically, highlighting concepts like permeability and emergent agent behavior. Our analysts criticized it as a lightweight rehash of older economic ideas, saying it lacked grounding in real-world AI applications and did not offer actionable insights — making it a purely speculative read.</description>

      <title>OpenAI will start asking for your ID in some cases as part of ChatGPT protections for teens [ * ]</title>
      <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-will-start-asking-for-your-id-in-some-cases-as-part-of-chatgpt</link>
      <description>OpenAI is introducing age‑prediction systems, automatic restrictions for under‑18 users (such as disabling flirtatious content, self‑harm instructions), parental controls, and in some cases ID verification. This is a big move in safety, ethics, and regulation for chatbots. Our analysts agreed that leaders need to know this, though it doesn’t directly impact enterprise workflows much — its importance lies in policy, user expectations, safety, and potentially compliance.</description>

      <link>https://x.com/Alibaba_Qwen/status/1970181599133344172</link>
      <description>Alibaba’s new omni‑modal model, which handles multiple input modalities and outputs, is open source, has several variants (instruct, thinking, captioner), and competes reasonably in cross‑modality benchmarks. Our analysts agreed this is a product announcement rather than a paradigm shift: until performance, robustness, adoption, and broader ecosystem impact are proven, it remains optional for most AI leaders.</description>

      <title>SchoolAI’s lessons in building an AI platform that empowers teachers [ * ]</title>
      <link>https://openai.com/index/schoolai/</link>
      <description>This case study shows how AI can be integrated into education in a thoughtfully designed way: supporting teachers, dashboards for tracking, respects human-in-the-loop, not replacing, but empowering. It’s a model for how AI could be responsibly used in educational settings. Our analysts felt that this is socially important and worth paying attention to, though for many AI leaders it may be less immediately critical.</description>

      <title>AI Generated “Workslop” Is Destroying Productivity [ ! ]</title>
      <link>https://hbr.org/2025/09/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity</link>
      <description>The article introduces a term “Workslop” when employees use AI to produce content that masquerades as good work, but lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a given task. Such workslop causes wasted time, frustration, and low return on investment despite widespread adoption of AI tools. Our analysts emphasized this as an emerging problem that leaders can and must control: setting up vetting, quality processes, human review, etc. They saw it as essential because unchecked workslop undermines productivity, credibility, and effectiveness of AI deployments.</description>
