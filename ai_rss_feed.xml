      <title>Forget Fine‑Tuning: SAP’s RPT‑1 Brings Ready‑to‑Use AI for Business Tasks [ ~ ]</title>
      <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/forget-fine-tuning-saps-rpt-1-brings-ready-to-use-ai-for-business-tasks</link>
      <description>This article covers SAP’s release of RPT‑1, a relational (“tabular”) foundation model aimed at business‑data tasks out of the box (e.g., spreadsheets, transactional data) rather than typical LLM fine‑tuning. While potentially interesting, our analysts judged it as early in market impact and less directly actionable for many AI leaders now.</description>

      <title>Stop Running So Many AI Pilots [ * ]</title>
      <link>https://hbr.org/2025/11/stop-running-so-many-ai-pilots</link>
      <description>This piece argues that AI leaders should move away from excessive pilot programs and instead focus on fewer, deeper, and more strategically aligned initiatives, citing Reckitt’s concentrated value-loop approach. The team emphasized that only 4% of companies take this “deep and narrow” route, yet those that do see twice the ROI, making it a compelling model for organizations looking to operationalize AI rather than just experiment. It also serves as a practical guide for prioritizing long-term, integrated AI deployments over scattered proofs of concept.</description>
