      <title>Agentic Context Engineering: Evolving Contexts for Self-Improving Language Models [ * ]</title>
      <link>https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04618</link>
      <description>This research paper introduces a three-part framework: generator, reflector, and curator, for improving LLMs by refining context (prompts, memories, evidence) rather than retraining models. While still theoretical, our analysts viewed it as an important early architecture for agentic systems, particularly for R&amp;D teams exploring agent role definition, memory persistence, and team-level self-improvement in AI environments.</description>

      <title>Breaking new ground: How Balfour Beatty is using Copilot to drive productivity at scale [ ~ ]</title>
      <link>https://ukstories.microsoft.com/features/how-balfour-beatty-is-using-copilot-to-drive-productivity-at-scale/</link>
      <description>Balfour Beatty’s adoption of Microsoft 365 Copilot across 27,000 employees has reportedly improved productivity, communication, and user confidence—especially among neurodiverse workers—according to internal surveys. While the rollout shows meaningful use of AI automation in construction, our analysts noted the case study lacked implementation depth and outcomes beyond self-reported sentiment, making it less relevant for AI leaders seeking replicable enterprise strategies.</description>

      <title>Krea Realtime 14B: Real‑Time, Long‑Form AI Video Generation [ ~ ]</title>
      <link>https://www.krea.ai/blog/krea-realtime-14b</link>
      <description>Krea’s Realtime 14B is a 14B-parameter autoregressive model capable of producing long-form AI-generated video with high temporal consistency using self-forcing techniques. Our analysts were impressed by the innovation but emphasized its niche use case and lack of clear enterprise applicability, calling it 'an innovation frontier story' with implications for AI in media, but not broadly actionable yet.</description>
