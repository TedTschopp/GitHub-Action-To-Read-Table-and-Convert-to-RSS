        "text": "This report reveals detailed, real‑world data from over 150 countries and all U.S. states on how Claude.ai and enterprise APIs are being used, showing not only what tasks are growing (education, science, coding) but also revealing large geographic/socioeconomic disparities in adoption. Our analysts highlighted that this kind of fine‑grained, open data is hugely informative, especially for seeing where AI is taking off vs where it’s lagging — making this critical for leaders thinking about economic impact and equitable access.",

      "Rationale": {
        "text": "This is a powerful case study showing how generative AI automates a very manual, tedious comparison task — Verisk now uses a chat‑style assistant to highlight changes in ISO rating documents, reducing what used to take days down to hours. Our analysts emphasized this as a useful, immediately applicable example: it shows clear ROI, complexity being handled, and value to users who don’t necessarily have deep AI expertise — making it essential reading.",
