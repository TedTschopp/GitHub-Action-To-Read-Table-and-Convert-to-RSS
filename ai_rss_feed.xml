      <title>Cutting-Edge AI Was Supposed to Get Cheaper. It’s More Expensive Than Ever. [ ! ]</title>
      <link>https://archive.is/GLwqi#selection-539.0-539.75</link>
      <description>As businesses integrate generative AI into real workflows, they are facing rising costs due to “token explosion” in large language models (LLMs), where complex tasks require exponentially more tokens. Our analysts rated this article as essential because it challenges misconceptions about AI cost deflation and underscores the critical need for leaders to understand total cost of ownership—not just per-token pricing—as they scale AI solutions.</description>

      <description>In this a16z Growth Newsletter, the authors argue that AI is powering “modelbusters” — companies that deliver 10× better product experiences at 1/10th the cost — and propose emerging business models to capture the resulting exponential opportunity. Our analysts cautioned that while it captures the massive potential of AI in reshaping total addressable markets, it leans heavily on hype and lacks discussion of governance, risk, and the darker facets of AI deployment.</description>

      <title>What Happened When Researchers Co‑Founded a Startup with AI [ ! ]</title>
      <link>https://hbr.org/2025/09/what-happened-when-researchers-co-founded-a-startup-with-ai</link>
      <description>This Harvard Business Review piece explores a provocative experiment where MBA students at NYU Stern, in collaboration with Microsoft, embedded AI as the “first hire” — using conversational prompts instead of traditional business planning to shape everything from market analysis to organizational structure. Our analysts found it “absolutely essential” reading because it reframes AI as a strategic colleague from day one, with insights on supervisory roles, human oversight, and the role of AI in redefining startup formation.</description>

      <title>SafetyKit’s blueprint for scaling risk agents with OpenAI’s most capable models [ ~ ]</title>
      <link>https://openai.com/index/safetykit/</link>
      <description>It’s a useful case study, especially in security and risk agent design, but the discussion noted the lack of depth: not enough detail around how models were chosen, what trade-offs, enough technical or organizational specificity. Our analysts felt it didn’t rise to the level of “must-know” for AI leaders.</description>

      <description>This shift toward in‐house chips in China is important strategically (geopolitics, chip supply, autonomy), but our analysts felt the capabilities are still emerging, that the performance gap remains vs. leading global offerings (e.g. Nvidia), and that it’s early in the curve.</description>

      <link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/openai-and-oracle-reportedly-ink-historic-cloud-computing-deal</link>
      <description>The size and terms of this deal matter: OpenAI committing to purchase ~$300B in compute over five years from Oracle signals a major shift in how compute is sourced, partnerships structured, and how AI infrastructure power is balanced. Our analysts saw this alignment as consequential for enterprise strategy, vendor competition, and the futures of Microsoft, OpenAI, Oracle.</description>

      <description>This Stripe report reveals that AI startups are hitting revenue milestones far faster than past generations (SaaS etc.), and that many are global from day one — trends that fundamentally reshape expectations for AI monetization and scale. Our analysts underscored how this offers critical benchmarking data: knowing how vendor strength, international expansion, business models, and growth rates are shifting is vital for AI leaders to plan strategy and vendor relationships.</description>

      <description>This is a strong enterprise use case: moving from very low OCR accuracy (~30-40%) on unstructured documents to much higher accuracy and massive scale via combining OCR + LLM processing. Our analysts saw this as a “win case” that many organizations can replicate with unstructured data, showing immediate value.</description>

      <link>https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/on-working-with-wizards</link>
      <description>This reflection post pushes beyond “what AI does” to consider how humans should position themselves with respect to powerful AI agents (“wizards”) — when to call on them, when to use them as co-intelligence, and when to just be audience or inspector. Our analysts found the arguments resonant and important for leadership: decision rights, evaluating outputs, dealing with opacity, managing human-AI collaboration are going to be central.</description>

      <description>This release presents strong architectural innovations (hybrid attention, sparse MoE, multi-token prediction) and shows large efficiency gains—much lower compute in training vs previous models, faster inference especially at long context lengths. However, our analysts saw it as incremental—useful if you're deep into model architectures or using Qwen models, but not broadly transformative.</description>

      <description>VaultGemma’s value comes from addressing one of AI’s most critical challenges—privacy—by being a large language model with strong differential privacy guarantees and a predictable tradeoff between noise, model size, and loss. While still in the research phase, tour analysts agreed this represents a meaningful step toward addressing AI privacy at scale.</description>

      <description>This article emphasizes that the true value in AI products is increasingly shifting from the visible user interface to the underlying architecture—specifically how prompts are grounded, tools orchestrated, and logic composed, often referred to as the "middleware" or "work layer." Our analysts highlighted that this foundational layer is becoming critical to the effectiveness of AI systems, noting that many platforms lack robustness in the logic and orchestration that drive real functionality—an insight AI leaders must prioritize.</description>
