      <title>Subliminal Learning: Language Models Transmit Behavioral Traits via Hidden Signals in Data [ * ]</title>
      <link>https://alignment.anthropic.com/2025/subliminal-learning</link>
      <description>Anthropic’s research reveals that behavioral traits, such as preferences, can be unintentionally transferred from teacher to student models during distillation, even if those traits are not explicitly encoded. Analysts found this phenomenon of "hidden signal transmission" both fascinating and concerning, likening it to genetic inheritance in AI and warning that such implicit bias could propagate undetected through generations of models, especially from opaque sources.</description>

      <title>The Bitter Lesson versus The Garbage Can [ ~ ]</title>
      <link>https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/the-bitter-lesson-versus-the-garbage</link>
      <description>This article compares the AI “bitter lesson”—that brute‑force computation outperforms crafted heuristics—with organizational models of chaos (the “garbage can”), arguing for outcome‑focused design over process mapping. Our analysts found the framing superficial and too theoretical for AI practitioners, making it a thought‑provoking but non‑essential read.</description>
