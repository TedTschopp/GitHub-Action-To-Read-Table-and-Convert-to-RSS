      "Rationale": {
        "text": "This paper introduces Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs)—a novel model architecture that frames prediction as energy minimization over input–output pairs, enabling models to \"think\" at inference time without extra supervision or modality-specific tuning. EBTs generalize across domains (text and vision) and outperform traditional transformer models in both efficiency and generalization. Our analysts noted it’s compelling for theory, but distant from practical deployment.",
